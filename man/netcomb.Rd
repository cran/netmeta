\description{
Some treatments in a network meta-analysis may be combinations of
other treatments or have common components. The influence of
individual components can be evaluated in an additive network
meta-analysis model assuming that the effect of treatment
combinations is the sum of the effects of its components. This
function implements this additive model in a frequentist way.
}
\details{
Treatments in network meta-analysis (NMA) can be complex
interventions. Some treatments may be combinations of others or
have common components. The standard analysis provided by
\code{\link{netmeta}} is a NMA where all existing (single or
combined) treatments are considered as different nodes in the
network. Exploiting the fact that some treatments are combinations
of common components, an additive component network meta-analysis
(CNMA) model can be used to evaluate the influence of individual
components. This model assumes that the effect of a treatment
combination is the sum of the effects of its components which
implies that common components cancel out in comparisons.

The additive CNMA model has been implemented using Bayesian methods
(Mills et al., 2012; Welton et al., 2013). This function implements
the additive model in a frequentist way (Rücker et al., 2020).

The underlying multivariate model is given by

\deqn{\bold{\delta} = \bold{B} \bold{\theta}, \bold{\theta} =
\bold{C} \bold{\beta}}

with \describe{
\item{\eqn{\bold{\delta}}}{vector of true treatment effects
  (differences) from individual studies,}
\item{\eqn{\bold{B}}}{design matrix describing the structure of the
  network,}
\item{\eqn{\bold{\theta}}}{parameter vector that represents the
  existing combined treatments,}
\item{\eqn{\bold{C}}}{matrix describing how the treatments are
  composed,}
\item{\eqn{\bold{\beta}}}{parameter vector representing the
  treatment components.}
}
All parameters are estimated using weighted least squares
regression.

Argument \code{inactive} can be used to specify a single component
that does not have any therapeutic value. Accordingly, it is
assumed that the treatment effect of the combination of this
component with an additional treatment component is equal to the
treatment effect of the additional component alone.

Argument \code{sep.comps} can be used to specify the separator
between individual components. By default, the matrix \strong{C} is
calculated internally from treatment names. However, it is possible
to specify a different matrix using argument \code{C.matrix}.

By default, component names are not abbreviated in
printouts. However, in order to get more concise printouts,
argument \code{nchar.comps} can be used to define the minimum
number of characters for abbreviated component names (see
\code{\link{abbreviate}}, argument \code{minlength}). R function
\code{\link{treats}} is utilised internally to create abbreviated
component names.
}
\note{
This function calculates effects for individual components and
complex interventions present in the network.

R function \code{\link{netcomplex}} can be used to calculate the
effect for arbitrary complex interventions in a component network
meta-analysis. Furthermore, R function \code{\link{netcomparison}}
can be used to calculate the effect for comparisons of two
arbitrary complex intervention in a component network
meta-analysis.
