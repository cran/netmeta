\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{netmeta}.}

\item{order}{A mandatory character or numerical vector specifying
the order of treatments (see Details).}

fixed effect (\code{"fixed"}) or random effects model
(\code{"random"}) should be plotted. Can be abbreviated.}

\item{xlab}{A label for the x-axis.}

\item{level}{The confidence level utilised in the plot. For the
funnel plot, confidence limits are not drawn if \code{yaxis =
"size"}.}

\item{pch}{The plotting symbol(s) used for individual studies
within direct comparisons.}

\item{col}{The colour(s) used for individual studies within direct
comparisons.}

\item{legend}{A logical indicating whether a legend with
information on direct comparisons should be added to the plot.}

\item{linreg}{A logical indicating whether result of linear
regression test for funnel plot asymmetry should be added to
plot.}

\item{rank}{A logical indicating whether result of rank test for
funnel plot asymmetry should be added to plot.}

\item{mm}{A logical indicating whether result of linear regression
test for funnel plot asymmetry allowing for between-study
heterogeneity should be added to plot.}

\item{pos.legend}{The position of the legend describing plotting
symbols and colours for direct comparisons.}

\item{pos.tests}{The position of results for test(s) of funnel plot
asymmetry.}

\item{text.linreg}{A character string used in the plot to label the
linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry.}

\item{text.rank}{A character string used in the plot to label the
rank test for funnel plot asymmetry.}

\item{text.mm}{A character string used in the plot to label the
linear regression test for funnel plot asymmetry allowing for
between-study heterogeneity.}

\item{sep.trts}{A character used in comparison names as separator
between treatment labels.}

\item{nchar.trts}{A numeric defining the minimum number of
characters used to create unique treatment names (see
\code{\link{netmeta}}).}

\item{backtransf}{A logical indicating whether results for relative
summary measures (argument \code{sm} equal to \code{"OR"},
\code{"RR"}, \code{"HR"}, or \code{"IRR"}) should be back
transformed in funnel plots. If \code{backtransf = TRUE}, results
for \code{sm = "OR"} are printed as odds ratios rather than log
odds ratios, for example.}

of test(s) for funnel plot asymmetry.}

\item{\dots}{Additional graphical arguments passed as arguments to
\code{\link{funnel.meta}}.}

\value{
A data frame with the following columns:

\description{
Draw a \sQuote{comparison-adjusted} funnel plot to assess funnel
plot asymmetry in network meta-analysis.
}
\details{
A \sQuote{comparison-adjusted} funnel plot (Chaimani & Salanti,
2012) is drawn in the active graphics window.

Argument \code{order} is mandatory to determine the order of
treatments (Chaimani et al., 2013):

\emph{\dQuote{Before using this plot, investigators should order
the treatments in a meaningful way and make assumptions about how
small studies differ from large ones. For example, if they
anticipate that newer treatments are favored in small trials, then
they could name the treatments from oldest to newest so that all
comparisons refer to \sQuote{old versus new intervention}. Other
possibilities include defining the comparisons so that all refer to
an active treatment versus placebo or sponsored versus
non-sponsored intervention.}}

The treatments can be either in increasing or decreasing order.

In the funnel plot, if \code{yaxis} is \code{"se"}, the standard
error of the treatment estimates is plotted on the y-axis which is
likely to be the best choice (Sterne & Egger, 2001). Other possible
choices for \code{yaxis} are \code{"invvar"} (inverse of the
variance), \code{"invse"} (inverse of the standard error), and
\code{"size"} (study size).
