\description{
This function transforms data that are given in wide or long
arm-based format (e.g. input format for WinBUGS) to a
contrast-based format that is needed as input to R function
\code{\link{netmeta}}. The function can transform data with binary,
continuous, or generic outcomes as well as incidence rates from
arm-based to contrast-based format.
}
\details{
R function \code{\link{netmeta}} expects data in a
\bold{contrast-based format}, where each row corresponds to a
comparison of two treatments and contains a measure of the
treatment effect comparing two treatments with standard error,
labels for the two treatments and an optional study label.  In
contrast-based format, a three-arm study contributes three rows
with treatment comparison and corresponding standard error for
pairwise comparison \emph{A} vs \emph{B}, \emph{A} vs \emph{C}, and
\emph{B} vs \emph{C} whereas a four-arm study contributes six rows
/ pairwise comparisons: \emph{A} vs \emph{B}, \emph{A} vs \emph{C},
\dots{}, \emph{C} vs \emph{D}.

Other programs for network meta-analysis in WinBUGS and Stata
require data in an \emph{arm-based} format, i.e. treatment estimate
for each treatment arm instead of a difference of two treatments. A
common \bold{(wide) arm-based format} consists of one data row per
study, containing treatment and other necessary information for all
study arms. For example, a four-arm study contributes one row with
four treatment estimates and corresponding standard errors for
treatments \emph{A}, \emph{B}, \emph{C}, and \emph{D}.  Another
possible arm-based format is a long format where each row
corresponds to a single study arm. Accordingly, in the \bold{long
arm-based format} a study contributes as many rows as treatments
considered in the study.

The pairwise function transforms data given in (wide or long)
arm-based format into the contrast-based format which consists of
\emph{pairwise} comparisons and is needed as input to the
\code{\link{netmeta}} function.

The pairwise function can transform data with binary outcomes (using the
\code{\link{metabin}} function from R package meta), continuous outcomes
(\code{\link{metacont}} function), incidence rates (\code{\link{metainc}}
function), and generic outcomes (\code{\link{metagen}} function). Depending
on the outcome, the following arguments are mandatory:
\itemize{
\item treat, event, n (see \code{\link{metabin}});
\item treat, n, mean, sd (see \code{\link{metacont}});
\item treat, event, time (see \code{\link{metainc}});
\item treat, TE, seTE (see \code{\link{metagen}}).
}

Argument \code{treat} is mandatory to identify the individual
treatments.  The other arguments contain outcome specific
data. These arguments must be either lists (wide arm-based format,
i.e., one row per study) or vectors (long arm-based format,
i.e., multiple rows per study) of the same length.

For the wide arm-based format, each list consists of as many
vectors of the same length as the multi-arm study with the largest
number of treatments. If a single multi-arm study has five arms,
five vectors have to be provided for each lists. Two-arm studies
have entries with \code{NA} for the third and subsequent
vectors. Each list entry is a vector with information for each
individual study; i.e., the length of this vector corresponds to
the total number of studies incorporated in the network
meta-analysis. Typically, list elements are part of a data frame
(argument \code{data}, optional); see Examples. An optional vector
with study labels can be provided which can be part of the data
frame.

In the long arm-based format, argument \code{studlab} is mandatory
to identify rows contributing to individual studies.

Additional arguments for meta-analysis functions can be provided using
argument \code{'\dots'}. The following is a list of some important
arguments:
\tabular{cll}{
Argument \tab Description \tab R function \cr
\code{sm} \tab Summary measure \tab \code{\link{metabin}},
  \code{\link{metacont}}, \code{\link{metainc}},
  \code{\link{metagen}} \cr
\code{method} \tab Meta-analysis method \tab \code{\link{metabin}},
  \code{\link{metainc}} \cr
\code{method.tau} \tab Estimation of between-study variance \tab
  \code{\link{metabin}}, \code{\link{metacont}},
  \code{\link{metainc}}, \code{\link{metagen}} \cr
\code{method.smd} \tab Standardised mean difference \tab
  \code{\link{metacont}}
}
More information on these as well as other arguments is given in
the help pages of R functions \code{\link{metabin}},
\code{\link{metacont}}, \code{\link{metainc}}, and
\code{\link{metagen}}, respectively.

The value of pairwise is a data frame with as many rows as there
are pairwise comparisons. For each study with \emph{p} treatments,
\emph{p*(p-1) / 2} contrasts are generated. Each row contains the
treatment effect (\code{TE}), its standard error (\code{seTE}), the
treatments compared ((\code{treat1}), (\code{treat2})) and the
study label ((\code{studlab})). Further columns are added according
to type of data.

All variables from the original dataset are also part of the output
dataset.  If data are provided in the long arm-based format, the
value of a variable can differ between treatment arms; for example,
the mean age or percentage of women in the treatment arm. In this
situation, two variables instead of one variable will be included
in the output dataset. The values "1" and "2" are added to the
names for these variables, e.g. "mean.age1" and "mean.age2" for the
mean age.

In general, any variable names in the original dataset that are
identical to the main variable names (i.e., "TE", "seTE", ...) will
be renamed to variable names with ending ".orig".
