\title{Network meta-analysis using graph-theoretical method}

\description{
  Network meta-analysis is a generalisation of pairwise meta-analysis
  that compares all pairs of treatments within a number of treatments
  for the same condition. The graph-theoretical method for analysis of
  network meta-analyses uses graph-theoretical methods that were
  originally developed in electrical network theory. It has been found
  to be equivalent to the frequentist approach to network
  meta-analysis (R端cker, 2012).

\details{
  Network meta-analysis using R package \bold{netmeta} is described in
  detail in Schwarzer et al. (2015), Chapter 8.
  
  Let \emph{n} be the number of different treatments (nodes, vertices)
  in a network and let \emph{m} be the number of existing comparisons
  (edges) between the treatments. If there are only two-arm studies,
  \emph{m} is the number of studies. Let TE and seTE be the vectors of
  observed effects and their standard errors. Let W be the
  \emph{m}x\emph{m} diagonal matrix that contains the inverse variance
  1/seTE^2.
  
  The given comparisons define the network structure. Therefrom an
  \emph{m}x\emph{n} design matrix B (edge-vertex incidence matrix) is
  formed; for more precise information, see R端cker (2012). Moreover,
  the \emph{n}x\emph{n} Laplacian matrix L and its Moore-Penrose
  pseudoinverse L+ are calculated (both matrices play an important
  role in graph theory and electrical network theory).  Using these
  matrices, the variances based on both direct and indirect
  comparisons can be estimated. Moreover, the hat matrix H can be
  estimated by \strong{H = BL+B^{t}W = B(B^{t} W B)^{+}B^{t}W} and
  finally consistent treatment effects can be estimated by applying
  the hat matrix to the observed (potentially inconsistent) effects. H
  is a projection matrix which maps the observed effects onto the
  consistent (n-1)-dimensional subspace. This is the Aitken estimator
  (Senn et al., 2013). As in pairwise meta-analysis, the Q statistic
  measures the deviation from consistency. Q can be separated into
  parts for each pairwise meta-analysis and a part for remaining
  inconsistency between comparisons.

  Often multi-arm studies are included in a network meta-analysis.  In
  multi-arm studies, the treatment effects on different comparisons
  are not independent, but correlated. This is accounted for by
  reweighting all comparisons of each multi-arm study. The method is
  described in R端cker (2012) and R端cker and Schwarzer (2014).

  Comparisons belonging to multi-arm studies are identified by
  identical study labels (argument \code{studlab}). It is therefore
  important to use identical study labels for all comparisons
  belonging to the same multi-arm study, e.g., study label
  "Willms1999" for the three-arm study in the data example (Senn et
  al., 2013). The function netmeta then automatically accounts for
  within-study correlation by reweighting all comparisons of each
  multi-arm study.

  Data entry for this function is in \emph{contrast-based} format,
  that is, data are given as contrasts (differences) between two
  treatments (argument \code{TE}) with standard error (argument
  \code{seTE}). In principle, meta-analysis functions from R package
  \bold{meta}, e.g. \code{\link{metabin}} for binary outcomes or
  \code{\link{metacont}} for continuous outcomes, can be used to
  calculate treatment effects separately for each treatment comparison
  which is a rather tedious enterprise. If data are provided in
  \emph{arm-based} format, that is, data are given for each treatment
  arm separately (e.g. number of events and participants for binary
  outcomes), a much more convenient way to transform data into
  contrast-based form is available. Function \code{\link{pairwise}}
  can automatically transform data with binary outcomes (using the
  \code{\link{metabin}} function from R package \bold{meta}),
  continuous outcomes (\code{\link{metacont}} function), incidence
  rates (\code{\link{metainc}} function), and generic outcomes
  (\code{\link{metagen}} function). Additional arguments of these
  functions can be provided, e.g., to calculate Hedges' \emph{g} or
  Cohen's \emph{d} for continuous outcomes (see help page of function
  \code{\link{pairwise}}).
  
  Note, all pairwise comparisons must be provided for a multi-arm
  study. Consider a multi-arm study of \emph{p} treatments with known
  variances.  For this study, treatment effects and standard errors
  must be provided for each of \emph{p}(\emph{p} - 1)/2 possible
  comparisons. For instance, a three-arm study contributes three
  pairwise comparisons, a four-arm study even six pairwise
  comparisons. Function \code{\link{pairwise}} automatically
  calculates all pairwise comparisons for multi-arm studies.
  
  A simple random effects model assuming that a constant heterogeneity
  variance is added to each comparison of the network can be defined
  via a generalised methods of moments estimate of the between-studies
  variance tau^2 (Jackson et al., 2012). This is added to the observed
  sampling variance seTE^2 of each comparison in the network (before
  appropriate adjustment for multi-arm studies). Then, as in standard
  pairwise meta-analysis, the procedure is repeated with the resulting
  enlarged standard errors.
  
  Internally, both fixed effects and random effects models are
  calculated regardless of values choosen for arguments
  \code{comb.fixed} and \code{comb.random}. Accordingly, the network
  estimates for the random effects model can be extracted from
  component \code{TE.random} of an object of class \code{"netmeta"}
  even if argument \code{comb.random=FALSE}. However, all functions in
  R package \bold{netmeta} will adequately consider the values for
  \code{comb.fixed} and \code{comb.random}. E.g. function
  \code{\link{print.summary.netmeta}} will not print results for the
  random effects model if \code{comb.random=FALSE}.

  By default, treatment names are not abbreviated in printouts. However,
  in order to get more concise printouts, argument \code{nchar.trts} can
  be used to define the minimum number of characters for abbreviated
  treatment names (see \code{\link{abbreviate}}, argument
  \code{minlength}). R function \code{\link{treats}} is utilised
  internally to create abbreviated treatment names.

  Names of treatment comparisons are created by concatenating
  treatment labels of pairwise comparisons using \code{sep.trts} as
  separator (see \code{\link{paste}}). These comparison names are used
  in the covariance matrices \code{Cov.fixed} and \code{Cov.random}
  and in some R functions, e.g, \code{\link{decomp.design}}. By
  default, a colon is used as the separator. If any treatment label
  contains a colon the following characters are used as separator (in
  consecutive order): \code{"-"}, \code{"_"}, \code{"/"}, \code{"+"},
  \code{"."}, \code{"|"}, and \code{"*"}.  If all of these characters
  are used in treatment labels, a corresponding error message is
  printed asking the user to specify a different separator.
