 ** Major changes **

    warning instead of an error message

  * League tables can be exported as CSV or Excel file

    - order of treatments in printouts corresponds to treatment
      comparison, e.g., "A:B" means that treatment "A" was compared
      with treatment "B" (and not the other way around).

    considered as treatment of interest or comparator (default),
    i.e., either comparisons of reference vs other treatments or
    other treatments vs reference are reported

  * Tests for heterogeneity and design inconsistency are shown in
    printouts

  * A biplot can be generated to show partial ordering of treatment
    rankings for more than two outcomes

 ** Major changes **

  * New function netleague() to print league table with network
    meta-analysis results

  * pairwise():
    - zero events for binary outcomes or incidence rates are handled
      correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
      treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent
      treatment effects for multi-arm studies were possible as

    - do not run all examples in forest.netmeta() as CRAN only allows
      a run time below 10 seconds for examples provided on a help page
    - R code to produce forest plot added to examples in dataset
      Wood2010

      from fixed effect model have been used
    - netmeta() excludes a treatment from list component 'seq' if all
      comparisons containing the respecitve treatment are excluded due to
      missing values in treatment effect or standard error
