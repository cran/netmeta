 ** Major changes **

  * Version of R package meta must be larger or equal 4.9-0

  * New function to produce forest plots with network, direct, and
    indirect evidence

  * New function to estimate additive network meta-analysis for
    combinations of treatments

  * New default in function netsplit(): treatment comparisons are
    selected from upper treatment estimates matrix, i.e., comparisons
    are "A vs B", "A vs C", and "B vs C" for treatments "A", "B", and
    "C" instead of "B vs A", etc.

  * Zero treatment arm variance in multi-arm studies results in a
    warning instead of an error message

  * League tables can be exported as CSV or Excel file

  * New argument 'backtransf' indicating whether estimates should be
    back-transformed in printouts and plots, e.g., to show results as
    odds ratios instead of log odds ratios

  * P-values can be printed in scientific notation

  * P-values equal to 0 are actually printed as "0" instead of
    "< 0.0001"

  * Thousands separator can be used in printouts and forest plots for
    large numbers

 ** User-visible changes **

  * new functions:
    - forest.netsplit() to produce forest plots with direct and
      indirect evidence
    - print.netleague() to print league table
    - treats() to create uniquely abbreviated treatment names
    - netcomb() and netcomb.netmeta() to estimate additive network
      meta-analysis models for combinations of treatments   
    - summary.netcomb(), print.netcomb(), and print.summary.netcomb()
      to print (summaries of) netcomb objects

  * print.decomp.design(), print.netmeta(), print.netsplit(), and
    print.summary.netmeta():
    - new argument 'big.mark' to specify character printed as
      thousands separator, e.g., big.mark = "," will result in
      printing of 1,000 for the number 1000
    - new argument 'scientific.pval' to print p-values in scientific
      notation, e.g., 1.2345e-01 instead of 0.12345

  * netmeta():
    - new argument 'backtransf' (see above)
    - new argument 'nchar.trts' to abbreviate treatment names in
      printouts

  * netleague():
    - function does not print league table, but only generates it
      (necessary for export of league table)
    - new arguments 'bracket' and 'separator' to define layout of
      confidence intervals (see R function cilayout() from R package
      meta)

  * netsplit():
    - new argument 'upper' to specify whether lower or upper triangle
      of treatment estimate matrix should be used to build comparisons
    - column with comparisons added to data frames with network, direct,
      and indirect estimates

      treats()
    - updated help pages for netposet() and netsplit()

 ** Bug fixes **

  * netsplit():
    - order of treatments in printouts corresponds to treatment
      comparison, e.g., "A:B" means that treatment "A" was compared
      with treatment "B" (and not the other way around).
      Side note, not sure whether this is a bug or a feature as "A:B"
      noted the design "comparison A and B" so far.

  * netposet():
    - function works with a ranking matrix that contains missing
      elements, i.e., rankings that do not include all treatments

  * netgraph():
    - areas for multi-arm studies are printed at the correct locations
      if argument 'start.layout' is not equal to "circle" and argument
      'seq' defines a specific treatment order (this bug was
      introduced in netmeta, version 0.7-0)

 ** Internal changes **

  * chkmultiarm():
    - warning for zero treatment arm variance instead of an error

  * new internal function uppertri() to extract elements from the

    package meta

 ** Major changes **

  * Prediction intervals can be calculated for treatment estimates
    from a network meta-analysis

  * In netmeta(), Q statistics for heterogeneity and design
    inconsistency are calculated according to Krahn et al. (2013);
    see help page of decomp.design()

  * In printouts and forest plots, the reference treatment can be
    considered as treatment of interest or comparator (default),
    i.e., either comparisons of reference vs other treatments or
    other treatments vs reference are reported

  * Tests for heterogeneity and design inconsistency are shown in
    printouts

  * A biplot can be generated to show partial ordering of treatment
    rankings for more than two outcomes

      treatment comparisons within a study

    - list element 'df' renamed to 'df.Q'
    - stop with an informative error message if (i) any treatment arm

      negative or zero, or (ii) in case of duplicate comparisons or an
      incomplete set of treatment comparisons within a study
    - argument 'details.tol.multiarm' renamed to 'details.chkmultiarm'

 ** Major changes **

  * New function netleague() to print league table with network
    meta-analysis results

  * pairwise():
    - zero events for binary outcomes or incidence rates are handled
      correctly in multi-arm studies by adding an increment to all
      treatment arms (in older versions of netmeta inconsistent
      treatment effects for multi-arm studies were possible as
      increments were considered in individual comparisons instead of
      all comparisons for a multi-arm study)

    - do not run all examples in forest.netmeta() as CRAN only allows
      a run time below 10 seconds for examples provided on a help page
    - R code to produce forest plot added to examples in dataset
      Wood2010

      from fixed effect model have been used
    - netmeta() excludes a treatment from list component 'seq' if all
      comparisons containing the respecitve treatment are excluded due to
      missing values in treatment effect or standard error

Help pages updated accordingly


2014-06-24, version 0.5-0

Functions nma.krahn, netmeasures, netheat, decomp.design, and
print.decomp.design:
- random effects network meta-analysis added

Function netheat:
- new argument 'random' 

Functions nma.krahn, decomp.design, and netheat:
- new argument 'tau.preset'

Function decomp.design:
- correct design-specific decomposition of Q statistic in network
   meta-analysis with multi-arm studies
- list component 'Q.design' renamed to 'Q.het.design'
- list component 'Q.detach' renamed to 'Q.inc.detach'
- list component 'residuals' renamed to 'residuals.inc.detach'
- new list components:
   'Q.inc.random', 'Q.inc.random.preset',
   'Q.inc.design.random.preset', 'residuals.inc.detach.random.preset', 
   'tau.preset'

New functions tau.within and decomp.tau (used internally)

Help pages updated accordingly


2014-05-27, version 0.4-4

Functions netmeta and nma.ruecker:
- modified such that the estimated tau-squared in random effects model
  considers multi-arm studies

Function print.netmeta:
- information on percentage weight not printed as interpretation is
  difficult

Dataset Senn2013:
- use of unpooled standard error for each treatment comparison


2014-04-14, version 0.4-3

Function netmeta:
- numeric values for arguments 'treat1' and 'treat2' not converted to
  character values (only factors converted to characters)
- check whether treatments are different (arguments 'treat1' and
  'treat2')

Function print.summary.netmeta:
- print random effects estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function forest.netmeta:
- sort treatment effect estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function nma.ruecker (used internally):
- changed such that all treatment effects are calculated irregardless
  of treatment order (some treatment effects remained NA depending on
  order of treatments)


2014-03-31, version 0.4-2

Function netmeasures:
- bug fix using correct formula to calculate direct evidence
  proportion (variance instead of standard error)
