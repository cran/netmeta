2014-06-24, version 0.5-0

Functions nma.krahn, netmeasures, netheat, decomp.design, and
print.decomp.design:
- random effects network meta-analysis added

Function netheat:
- new argument 'random' 

Functions nma.krahn, decomp.design, and netheat:
- new argument 'tau.preset'

Function decomp.design:
- correct design-specific decomposition of Q statistic in network
   meta-analysis with multi-arm studies
- list component 'Q.design' renamed to 'Q.het.design'
- list component 'Q.detach' renamed to 'Q.inc.detach'
- list component 'residuals' renamed to 'residuals.inc.detach'
- new list components:
   'Q.inc.random', 'Q.inc.random.preset',
   'Q.inc.design.random.preset', 'residuals.inc.detach.random.preset', 
   'tau.preset'

New functions tau.within and decomp.tau (used internally)

Help pages updated accordingly


2014-05-27, version 0.4-4

Functions netmeta and nma.ruecker:
- modified such that the estimated tau-squared in random effects model
  considers multi-arm studies

Function print.netmeta:
- information on percentage weight not printed as interpretation is
  difficult

Dataset Senn2013:
- use of unpooled standard error for each treatment comparison


2014-04-14, version 0.4-3

Function netmeta:
- numeric values for arguments 'treat1' and 'treat2' not converted to
  character values (only factors converted to characters)
- check whether treatments are different (arguments 'treat1' and
  'treat2')

Function print.summary.netmeta:
- print random effects estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function forest.netmeta:
- sort treatment effect estimates according to argument 'seq'

Function nma.ruecker (used internally):
- changed such that all treatment effects are calculated irregardless
  of treatment order (some treatment effects remained NA depending on
  order of treatments)


2014-03-31, version 0.4-2

Function netmeasures:
- bug fix using correct formula to calculate direct evidence
  proportion (variance instead of standard error)


2014-03-21, version 0.4-1

Function netmeta:
- Argument 'seq' added (see also R function netgraph)

Function netgraph:
- new default for argument 'seq'

Help pages updated accordingly

Some internal code cleaning to improve readability of R functions


2014-03-07, version 0.4-0

New functions added:
- netgraph (network graph)
- netheat (net heat graph)
- netmeasures (measures for network meta-analysis)
- decomp.design (design-based decomposition of Cochran's Q)
- print.decomp.design (corresponding print function)
- p.ci, format.TE, nma.krahn, nma.ruecker (used internally)

Function netmeta:
- Check added whether all pairwise comparisons are provided for
  multi-arm studies

Help pages added for new functions

Help page of function netmeta updated


2013-08-01, version 0.3-1

Functions netmeta and summary.netmeta:
- new list component n (number of treatments)

Function print.summary.netmeta:
- modified such that number of treatments is printed
- modified such that argument 'reference.group' works as expected for
  random effects model


2013-07-24, version 0.3-0

First version released on CRAN
